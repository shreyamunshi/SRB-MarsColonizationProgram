# SRB-MarsColonizationProgram

This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action on a 2D grid.
There are two algorithms which are used in this project.
Dijkstra's Algorithm   - The father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
 A*'s Algorithm   -  Uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's
